# Titan-City-3023
**"Titan Frontier: Exploration of the Unknown" is a game created during a 2 day hackathon for the 2023 Nasa Space Apps Challenge which was hosted in Mississiagua.**
We developed 'Titan Frontier - Exploring The Unknown' in response to the declining youth interest in space exploration. This game, suitable for all age groups but with a focus on educating young minds, 
offers an engaging and informative experience. It comprises a series of mini-challenges mirroring the steps of planning and executing a space mission, including launch sequencing, trajectory planning, 
site selection, resource management, and colony building. 'Titan Frontier' aims to inspire current and future space enthusiasts, providing valuable insights into mission planning intricacies 
and the challenges of space exploration. Made with Pygame
